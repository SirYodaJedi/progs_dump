******************************************************
******************************************************

ALWAYS START A NEW FOLDER WHEN USING PROGS_DUMP.
DO NOT COPY FILES OVER AN EXISTING VERSION.

******************************************************
******************************************************

The devkit consists of two elements:

First, thereâ€™s the "pd_300" mod folder. This holds all the sample maps,
mapping assets, source code and the documentation you are reading now.

The second element is the "my_mod" folder inside the "mod_template.zip" file.
This is a streamlined version of progs_dump with just the assets you need to
make your own mod.

The workflow is simple:

Use "pd_300" as a reference and learning tool, then create your own
Quake mod with the "my_mod" folder as a base.

NOTE: Your project should be  released as a stand-alone
mod and installed into its own folder in the Quake directory.

Please DO NOT include any of the sample maps in your mod.

==============================================================================

INSTALLATION:

Unzip this archive into your Quake directory. This should create a folder called
"pd_300" Run Quake with the following command line:

-game pd_300 +map start

or run Quake as usual and type

game pd_300

in the console and hit enter. Then use the menu to start a new game.

Some newer source ports like Ironwail have a "Mod" menu item that makes this even
easier.

Or use Simple Quake launcher to launch Quake with "pd_300" as the selected mod.

Take a tour and play the included sample maps. The sources are included for your
reference. pd_300.wad contains all textures from the sample maps.

Use the included FGD files with TrenchBroom or JACK or the DEF file with other
editors.

==============================================================================

This is a compilation of QuakeC code from various sources. Use at your own risk.
PLEASE contact me if you use progs_dump for a project, I'd love to see your

==============================================================================
We no longer recommend Darkplaces or MarkV for progs_dump. Although many 
features will work, these engines are untested and unsupported.
==============================================================================

==============================================================================

Known issues:

GENERAL ISSUES:

* progs_dump is untested in COOP
* Cutscenes display crosshairs if enabled.
* Using snd_hit on a style 4 or 5 monster_army will crash the game. Use style 3
  if you need a custom hit sound.

KEX ENGINE:

* Cutscenes "jitter" when mouse is moved.
* Some systems will have frame rate dips when Chthon is gibbed in the KEX engine.
* The sky in pd_cutscenes displays artifacts. This is an issue with the non-standard 
  sky texture used in this map.
* "Congratulations" graphics does not display when using info_intermissiontext.

FTEQW:

* Cutscenes "jitter" when mouse is moved unless host_maxfps is set to 72.
* Sleeping Zombies in pd_zombies spawn incorrectly but do not affect game play. 
  As a workaround do not cover sleeping zombies with any brushes if they are 
  touching the monster.
* Rendering issues in certain presets. We recommend using "Spasm, Vanilla"
  or "Normal" Graphics Presets in the Option menu.
* misc_model set to animate in reverse (speed -0.1) will not animate.
* A speed setting of -1 (change instantly) does not work on trigger_fog
